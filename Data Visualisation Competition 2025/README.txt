Overview
This data package provides modelled estimates of the projected socio-economic co-benefits associated with the net-zero actions recommended by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) in the UK's Seventh Carbon Budget. The data cover 46,426 small areas across the UK and are disaggregated by co-benefit type and, where applicable, co-benefit damage pathway, for the period 2025 to 2050.

Dataset Structure
The dataset is provided at three levels of complexity:

Level 1: Total modelled co-benefits across all 46,426 small areas, disaggregated by 11 co-benefit types for 2025 to 2050.
Level 2: Annual and total co-benefits across small areas, disaggregated by 11 co-benefit types for 2025 to 2050.
Level 3: Annual and total co-benefits across small areas, disaggregated by 11 co-benefit types and associated co-benefit damage pathways for 2025 to 2050.

Interpretation and Units
- All monetary values are given in million GBP.
- Base year: 2025.
- All values are discounted using rates set by UK Green Book guidance (separate health and non-health rates).
- Values are net present values. Negative values represent net costs.
- Data are provided at the small area level (datazone or lower super output area). Lookups are included to aggregate to local authority, regional, and national scales.
- Some variance is present in annual values, and smoothing may be required for time-series analysis.
- Some small areas have undergone administrative boundary changes between 2011 and 2021. Lookup tables are provided to support consistent aggregation.

Glossary of Co-Benefit Types
small_area: Geographical areas - high-resolution administrative boundaries (datazones in Northern Ireland, Scotland, lower-super output areas in England, Wales).
air_quality: Benefits of reduced air pollution due to lower use of carbon-intensive heating and transport, valued in improved health and reduced building damages.
congestion: Impacts of reduced or increased traffic congestion resulting from changes in road use.
dampness: Benefits from reductions in damp housing, reflected in improved health and wellbeing.
diet_change: Health improvements from increased plant-based dietary shifts.
excess_cold: Benefits of warmer homes through insulation and efficient heating systems, valued through avoided health and wellbeing damages.
excess_heat: Benefits of improved ventilation and cooling reducing overheating risk in homes.
hassle_costs: Costs associated with increased journey durations where shifts away from private vehicle use occur. Referred to as 'longer travel times' in UK Co-Benefits Atlas.
noise: Benefits of reduced noise pollution from modal shift or quieter vehicles.
physical_activity: Health and longevity benefits from increased active travel (walking and cycling).
road_repairs: Impacts on road maintenance requirements due to changes in road usage.
road_safety: Impacts on collision incidence and risk associated with changes in vehicle travel.

Damage Pathways (Level 3 Only)
reduced_mortality: Direct health benefits reflected in reduced premature deaths.
society: Wider non-health impacts accruing to society.
time_saved: Benefits from reduced travel times or costs associated with increased travel times.
NHS: Health care cost savings to the National Health Service.
QALY: Gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy due to improved health outcomes.

Damage Type (Level 3 Only)
health: Benefits associated with health improvements
non-health: Benefits not associated with health improvements
